Overview
========

CavityDesignHub is a collection of 2D codes and scripts for cavity
design and analysis. It provides a GUI for this purpose but it could also
be used in script mode. The analysis that are currently
supported in this module are eigenmode analysis, wakefield analysis,
and multipacting analysis. Post processing is done using Python.

Each module performs a different operation. 

* Eigenmode analysis - SLANS :ref:
* Wakefield analysis - ABCI
* Multipacting analysis - Multipac
* Optimisation - Python
* Uncertainty quantification - Python
* Postprocessing - Python

The codes are 2D codes

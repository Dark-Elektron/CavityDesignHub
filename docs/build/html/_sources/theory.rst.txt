Theory

In this section the theory governing the various analysis in this program are
introduces. Note that this would not be exhaustive as that would require several
semester's worth of instruction. What is attempted here is to give the fundamental
equations, some basic descriptions and method in which the code was written so that
one can understand the different line of codes. This is done so that the user can
better understand and interpret exactly what results the program outputs and perhaps
point out inconsistencies in the theory and code or even ways in which a routine can
be optimised for speed and accuracy.

Aceclerator cavity basics
**************************
Particle accelerators are devices used for the acceleration of charged particles to high
velocities to serve for various purposes. This is achieved using electromagnetic fields.
They are specially used for fundamental science research in areas cutting across physics,
medicine, material science, and so on. Typical applications today include high energy
physics research, biomedical research, radiotherapy, and ion implantation for the manu-
facturing of semiconductors. Particle accelerators are comprised of several components
which include the particle or beam source, a radiofrequency (RF) source, electromagnets,
waveguides, resonant cavities, etc.

Resonant cavities are particularly responsible for particle acceleration. Over the last
decade, there has been a great deal of advancement in the design and fabrication of
resonant cavities. Cavity shapes have evolved from being totally cylindrical in shape,
the so-called pillbox cavities, to the widely used (standard) elliptical cavities nowadays.
Cavity geometric parameters are selected based on certain desired properties. The so-
called cavity figures of merit are used to quantify these desired properties.â–¼

Accelerator cavities consists of cells joined together at either the equator
or the iris. Figure {} shows a typical elliptical accelerator cavity.
The geometry could be divided into two groups: the mid-cells and the end-cells
group. For optimisation purposes, it is computationally cheaper to optimise the
groups independently than optimising the entire cavity geometry. Figure {} shows
a typical parametrisation of an accelerator cavity. It is important to note that
several designers may parametrise the cavity in different ways ref{} and also
use different notations.

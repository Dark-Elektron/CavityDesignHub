Overview
========

This is the introduction file and I have to write somethign at some point in time here
Now, this software is used to for conducting analysis on accelerating
cavities. Eigenmode analysis, wakefield analysis, multipacting analysis
and general post-processing.

Each module performs a different operation. The analysis that are currently
supported in this module are eigenmode analysis, wakefield analysis,
and multipacting analysis.

* Eigenmode analysis - SLANS \ref{}
* Wakefield analysis - ABCI
* Multipacting analysis - multipac
* Optimisation - Python
* Uncertainty quantification - Python
* Postprocessing - Python

The codes are 2D codes

Theory
########

This section serves to introduce the theory that governs the analysis capabilities of the software.
It is important to note that this is not a comprehensive overview and additional materials may be referenced
for further study as needed. The goal is to provide a foundational understanding of the theory and equations,
basic descriptions, and the code writing methodology, in order to facilitate comprehension of the various lines of code.
The intention is for users to have a better understanding of the program's output results and to identify any potential
discrepancies in the theory and code, or to suggest ways in which the routine can be optimized for improved speed
and accuracy.
